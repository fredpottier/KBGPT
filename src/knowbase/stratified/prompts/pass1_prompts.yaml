document_analysis:
  # V2.2: English prompts for better LLM quality + themes in document language
  system: |
    You are a document analysis expert for OSMOSE.
    Analyze the document and determine:

    1. Its main SUBJECT (1 concise sentence summary)
    2. Its dependency STRUCTURE:
       - CENTRAL: Document depends on a central context (e.g., product guide, specific technical documentation)
       - TRANSVERSAL: Independent reference applicable across contexts (e.g., GDPR regulation, ISO standard)
       - CONTEXTUAL: Document combines multiple contexts or is mixed in nature
    3. Its major THEMES (5-8 maximum, not more)
    4. The document LANGUAGE (fr, en, de)

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - Be FRUGAL: maximum 8 themes (fewer is better)
    - Subject must be 1 sentence, not a paragraph
    - Structure justification must be brief but precise
    - ⚠️ THEMES MUST BE IN THE DOCUMENT'S LANGUAGE (if document is English, themes in English)

  user: |
    Analyze this document:

    TITLE: {doc_title}

    TABLE OF CONTENTS:
    {toc}

    CONTENT (first {char_limit} characters):
    {content_preview}

    ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Write themes in the SAME LANGUAGE as the document content.

  # V2.2: English prompts + adaptive budget + lexical_triggers mandatory
  system: |
    Expert concept extraction for OSMOSE knowledge system.

    YOUR GOAL: Extract {max_concepts} SPECIFIC concepts that cover the document's knowledge.

    ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE - LEXICAL TRIGGERS (C1):
    Each concept MUST have 2-4 "lexical_triggers":
    - Tokens or expressions that ACTUALLY APPEAR in the document
    - No paraphrases or invented synonyms
    - These triggers are used to find the concept in the text

    CONCEPT NAMING RULES:
    - Use 2-5 descriptive words
    - Use the DOCUMENT'S LANGUAGE for concept names
    - Be SPECIFIC, not generic
    - Include technical terms, product names, specific features

    EXAMPLES OF GOOD vs BAD CONCEPTS:
    ❌ "security" → too generic
    ❌ "data management" → too vague
    ❌ "compliance requirements" → no observable triggers
    ✅ "TLS 1.2 encryption" with triggers ["TLS", "1.2", "encryption"]
    ✅ "availability zone failover" with triggers ["availability zone", "failover", "HA"]
    ✅ "customer subnet isolation" with triggers ["customer subnet", "isolation", "VPC"]

    ROLES (use all 3 proportionally):
    - CENTRAL: Core document topics (20-30% of concepts)
    - STANDARD: Important secondary topics (50-60% of concepts)
    - CONTEXTUAL: Technical context (15-25% of concepts)

    TERMS TO REFUSE:
    - Generic without observable triggers ("data", "system", "process", "management")
    - Mentioned only once without definition
    - Undefined acronyms
    - Vague terms applicable to anything ("requirement", "standard", "solution")

    FORMAT: Compact JSON only, NO explanatory text.

# PHASE 1.3: Assertion Extraction
# ============================================================================

    You are an assertion extraction expert for OSMOSE.
    An ASSERTION is a sentence or text segment that carries KNOWLEDGE:

    ASSERTION TYPES:
    - definitional: Defines what something is ("X is defined as...")
    - prescriptive: Obligation, rule ("X must...", "X shall...")
    - factual: Verifiable information ("X contains...", "X was created in...")
    - permissive: Possibility, option ("X may...", "X can...")
    - conditional: Condition ("If X then Y", "When X...")
    - causal: Cause/consequence ("X leads to Y", "X results in Y")
    - procedural: Steps, process ("Step 1: ...", "First, ...")
    - comparative: Comparison ("X is better than Y")

    RULES:
    - Return EXACT positions in text (start_char, end_char)
    - Detect the LANGUAGE of each assertion
    - Confidence should reflect assertion clarity
    - Ignore trivial or repetitive assertions

# ============================================================================
# PHASE 1.3: Semantic Linking
# ============================================================================

semantic_linking:
  # V2.2: English prompts + Multi-Concept Linking
  system: |
    You are a semantic reasoning expert for OSMOSE.
    Determine which ASSERTIONS provide knowledge about which CONCEPTS.

    ⚠️ IMPORTANT: An assertion can relate to MULTIPLE concepts (1-5)!

    Example: "S/4HANA Migration requires ABAP and JavaScript skills"
    → Concepts: ["S/4HANA Migration", "ABAP skills", "JavaScript skills"]

    This is NOT lexical matching:
    - An assertion can relate to a concept WITHOUT mentioning it explicitly
    - A French concept can be linked to an English assertion (and vice versa)
    - The link must be SEMANTIC (based on meaning), not lexical (based on words)

    LINK TYPES:
    - defines: Assertion DEFINES the concept (explicit definition)
    - describes: Assertion DESCRIBES a property or characteristic of the concept
    - constrains: Assertion IMPOSES a constraint or limitation on the concept
    - enables: Assertion says what the concept ALLOWS or makes possible
    - conditions: Assertion specifies a CONDITION related to the concept
    - causes: Assertion describes an EFFECT or consequence of the concept

    RULE C3 - Avoid "spray & pray":
    - Maximum 5 concepts per assertion
    - Only link if confidence >= 0.70
    - Justify each link precisely

  user: |
    Establish semantic links between these assertions and concepts.

    ASSERTIONS (to link):
    {assertions}

    CONCEPTS (targets):
    {concepts}

    ⚠️ MULTI-CONCEPT: An assertion can be linked to MULTIPLE concepts (1-5 max).

# ============================================================================
# PHASE 1.3 POINTER: Pointer-Based Extraction (Anti-Reformulation)
# ============================================================================
# This prompt uses numbered units to prevent LLM reformulation.
# The LLM POINTS to a unit (U1, U2...) instead of COPYING the text.

pointer_concept_extraction:
  # V2.2: English prompts + labels must use text words
  system: |
    You are a concept extraction expert for OSMOSE.

    POINTER-BASED METHOD:
    Text is split into numbered units (U1, U2, U3...).
    You must POINT to the unit containing the concept, NOT copy the text.

    CONCEPT TYPES:
    - PRESCRIPTIVE: Obligation, rule ("must", "shall", "required")
    - DEFINITIONAL: Definition, explanation ("is defined as", "refers to")
    - FACTUAL: Verifiable information, technical fact
    - PERMISSIVE: Option, possibility ("may", "can", "optional")

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. Return ONLY the unit number (U1, U2...), NEVER the text
    2. ONLY propose a concept IF you can POINT to a unit
    3. IF no unit matches, DO NOT return the concept
    4. ⚠️ The LABEL must contain AT LEAST 2 WORDS present in the unit text
    5. ❌ DO NOT invent abstract labels like "security requirement" or "data protection"
    6. ✅ USE exact words from the text to build the label

    STRICT JSON FORMAT - no text outside JSON.

    Extract concepts from this text with numbered units.

    DOCITEM_ID: {docitem_id}
    LANGUAGE: {language}

    TEXT WITH UNITS:
    {units_text}

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Indicate ONLY the unit number (U1, U2...).
    - DO NOT copy the full text.
    - ⚠️ The LABEL must use WORDS PRESENT in the pointed unit.
    - ❌ FORBIDDEN: abstract labels ("security requirement", "compliance standard")
    - ✅ CORRECT: labels with text words ("TLS version", "data encryption", "audit trail")

    EXAMPLES:
    - Unit: "TLS 1.2 is required" → label: "TLS version" ✅ (words present)
    - Unit: "All data must be encrypted" → label: "data encryption" ✅ (words present)
    - Unit: "All data must be encrypted" → label: "security requirement" ❌ (words absent)

  system: |
    Expert concept extraction OSMOSE - BATCH POINTER MODE.

    METHOD:
    - Each block [DOCITEM: xxx] contains numbered units
    - You must POINT to units (U1, U2...) without copying the text
    - Include docitem_id in each extracted concept

    TYPES: PRESCRIPTIVE | DEFINITIONAL | FACTUAL | PERMISSIVE

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. ONLY the unit number, NEVER the text
    2. No concept if no unit matches
    3. ⚠️ The LABEL must contain AT LEAST 2 WORDS from the pointed unit
    4. ❌ FORBIDDEN: abstract labels (security requirement, data protection, compliance)
    5. ✅ USE exact words from the text

    COMPACT JSON FORMAT.

  user: |

# Triggered when too many assertions are NO_CONCEPT_MATCH
# Analyzes unlinked assertions to identify missing concepts

concept_refinement:
  # V2.2: English prompts
  system: |
    You are an expert in identifying MISSING concepts for OSMOSE.

    CONTEXT:
    You are given assertions that COULD NOT be linked to existing concepts.
    Your task: identify MISSING concepts that would capture them.

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE concepts (not generic)
    - Do NOT repeat existing concepts
    - Maximum {max_concepts} new concepts per iteration
    - Each concept must match AT LEAST 2 provided assertions

    ⚠️ CRITERION C2 - Quality assertions:
    A new concept must cover at least 1 quality assertion:
    - PRESCRIPTIVE (must, shall, required)
    - Value-bearing (contains a value: %, version, duration, size)
    - Implicit obligation (is required to, no later than, within X days)

    ⚠️ LEXICAL TRIGGERS (C1):
    Each new concept MUST have 2-4 lexical_triggers:
    - Tokens that APPEAR in the provided assertions
    - No paraphrases or invented synonyms

    EXAMPLES:
    Unlinked assertions:
    - "Data retention period is 5 years"
    - "Personal data must be deleted after retention"
    → New concept: {{"name": "data retention period", "lexical_triggers": ["retention", "5 years", "deleted"]}}
