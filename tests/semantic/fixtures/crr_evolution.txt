Customer Retention Rate: Evolution and Standards

Version History

The Customer Retention Rate (CRR) metric has evolved significantly over the past three years. This document tracks the key changes and provides the current standard definition.

2022 - Original Definition (v1.0)

The initial CRR formula was simple:
CRR = (Customers at End of Period / Customers at Start of Period) × 100

However, this methodology was criticized because it did not account for new customer acquisitions during the period. Therefore, we revised the approach.

2023 - Revised Methodology (v2.0)

Based on stakeholder feedback, the formula was updated in March 2023:
CRR = ((E - N) / S) × 100

Where:
- E = Customers at end of period
- N = New customers acquired
- S = Customers at start of period

This revision superseded the previous version as a result of a comprehensive review. The change led to more accurate retention tracking.

2024 - ISO 23592 Compliant (v3.0)

In January 2024, we aligned our CRR calculation with ISO 23592 international standard. The updated formula now includes:

CRR = ((E - N) / S) × 100
With mandatory quarterly measurement periods and customer segmentation requirements.

This latest version replaced all previous methodologies. Organizations must now use this standard because it ensures comparability across industries.

Key Changes Summary:
- v1.0 → v2.0: Added new customer adjustment (revised March 2023)
- v2.0 → v3.0: ISO compliance + segmentation (updated January 2024)

Current Status: v3.0 is the active standard. Previous versions are deprecated and should no longer be used.
